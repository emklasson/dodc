----- v1.50, 10 Feb 2026
+ chooses SNFS parameters dynamically.
+ exits immediately if Ctrl-C is pressed twice.
* proper skew for SNFS poly.


----- v1.40, 07 Feb 2026
+ change settings while dodc is running by writing them to dodc_live.cfg using
  the same syntax and parameters as dodc.cfg. Very useful for changing e.g. nmax
  or worker_threads.
+ cado_snfs and cado_gnfs methods are now available if you've got a functional
  cado-nfs system set up. SNFS uses straight-forward polynomials created from
  the k*2^n+-1 expression and static parameters from the example for 2^512+1. It
  seems to work well enough for n around there, but presumably increasingly
  terrible the further away you get. GNFS uses cado-nfs' built-in poly search.
+ new "internet_timeout" setting aborts internet requests after a while.
+ new "pcore_workers" setting schedules some workers with Background QoS class
  (macOS only). That runs those workers on Efficency cores only.
+ new "exclude_reservations" setting to skip downloading other people's reserved
  numbers.
+ new "auto_reserve" and "reserve_url" settings to automatically reserve large
  numbers you're doing QS or NFS on.
+ added SIGINT handler to gracefully exit when Ctrl-C is pressed.
+ scientific notation for integer settings values.
* overhauled config handling for better robustness and changed all setting names
  to snake_case instead of justwordssmushedtogether.
* renamed dodc.ini to dodc.cfg.


----- v1.36, 21 Jan 2026
+ batch submit all unsubmitted factors instead of one by one.
+ new "submitinterval" setting limits server communication.
* updated code to build on macOS.


----- v1.35, 25 Apr 2013
* updated gmp-ecm's sigma parsing to work with newer versions.


----- v1.32, 26 Feb 2009
+ added automation for snfs jobs using ggnfs.


----- v1.31, 11 Feb 2009
+ if more than 1 worker thread was still running when dodc was about to exit,
  they would all be allowed to complete but only the first found factor would
  be saved/submitted.
+ all unrecognized methods defaulted to ecm, including "p-1" instead of "P-1".


----- v1.30, 06 Mar 2007
+ new "worker_threads" setting: dodc starts this many worker threads
  simultaneously. Makes it a bit easier to use multiprocessor systems.
+ many things...


----- v1.10, 18 Mar 2004
+ new "b1increase" setting increases b1 by this much each time doecm loops.
+ doesn't "scientify" (1000000->1e6) reported b1 value if the result would
  have an exponent less than 4.
+ "order = random" processes the composites in random order.
+ new "recommendedwork" setting let's doecm do the work that the server feels
  is most needed. This only works if you're using the autodownload feature.
+ new "fallback" setting switches to "recommendedwork = yes" if your primary
  list of composites is exhausted. Otherwise doecm quits when that happens.
+ new "method" setting allows easy switching between ECM, P-1, and P+1. Be
  sure to coordinate your effort with the project coordinator if you intend to
  do anything other than ECM though, as the others waste effort when several
  people do the same thing. Just stick with ECM.
+ new "submitretryinterval" setting sets the number of minutes between retry
  attempts when a factor submission has failed.


----- v1.01, 04 Mar 2004
+ fixed a minor annoyance in the cmdline parser.
+ if you had once gotten an autosubmit failure doecm would keep telling you
  you had unsubmitted factors even though it had subsequently submitted them
  properly.
+ included 11*2^n+-1 in doecm.ini.


----- v1.00, 03 Mar 2004
+ if there is some error during the autosubmit process the factor is now saved
  to <submitfailurefile> and is regularly resubmitted until it succeeds.


----- v0.91, 03 Mar 2004
+ sends "args" and "submitter" fields when submitting factors.
+ downloads composites in gzipped format if "use_gzip = yes". This cuts
  about 50% off the download size.
+ if "reportwork = yes" doecm sends a report of how many curves you ran,
  what B1 you used, and what numbers you tried to factor once all composites
  are processed. This will be helpful when guessing how big the remaining
  factors are.
+ sorts composites in descending order if "order = desc".


----- v0.90, 29 Feb 2004
+ Initial release.
